The data in this question is simple and can derive a conclusion without a chart.

#### Comments
The traffic from Google searches with nonbrand keywords is the main source compared to other sources. We should investigate this more to find out whether it could get better.

## Question 1

Calculate the conversion rate from session to order? The company needs a conversion rate of at least 4%.

_Received date: Apr 14, 2012_

#### SQL query 
Using window functions
```
WITH cte AS 
(	
	SELECT 
		COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) AS sessions, 
		COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders 
	FROM website_sessions ws 
	LEFT JOIN orders o 
		ON o.website_session_id = ws.website_session_id 
	WHERE 
		ws.created_at < '2012-04-14' AND 
		utm_source = 'gsearchâ€™ AND 
		utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
) 
SELECT *, orders/sessions as conv_rate FROM cte;
```
#### Command & Results
```
python3 connect.py --question 1 --db 'mavenfuzzyfactory user password' -task 'run'
```

The data in this question is simple and can derive a conclusion without a chart.

#### Comments
It is clear that the conversion rate of Google search - nonbrand source did not meet the requirement.  

## Question 2

Pull gsearch nonbrand trended session volume by week to check whether the bid changes (2012-04-15) have caused the volume to drop.

_Received date: May 12, 2012_

#### SQL query 
```
SELECT 
	MIN(DATE(created_at)) AS week_start_date, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions 
FROM website_sessions 
WHERE 
	created_at < '2012-05-10' AND 
	utm_source = 'gsearch' AND 
	utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' 
GROUP BY 
	YEARWEEK(created_at);
```
#### Command & Results
```
python3 connect.py --question 2 --db 'mavenfuzzyfactory user password' -task 'run'
```

It is more easy to see the trend with a line graph.

#### Comments
The number of sessions went down significantly; hence, the source could be sensitive to the bidding price.

## Question 3

Continue with the gsearch-nonbrand, pull conversion rates from session to order by device type.

_Received date: May 11, 2012_

#### SQL query 
Using window functions
```
WITH cte AS 
(
	SELECT 
		ws.device_type, 
		COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) AS sessions, 
		COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders 
	FROM website_sessions ws
	LEFT JOIN orders o 
		ON o.website_session_id = ws.website_session_id 
	WHERE 
		ws.created_at < '2012-05-11' AND 
		utm_source = 'gsearch' AND 
		utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' 
	GROUP BY 
		ws.device_type
) 
SELECT *, orders/sessions as conv_rate 
FROM cte;
```
#### Command & Results
```
python3 connect.py --question 3 --db 'mavenfuzzyfactory user password' -task 'run'
```

#### Comments
Sessions from desktop devices generated higher CTR, so to improve the conversion rate of the source, from insights from Q2 and Q3, the company could increase the budget, bidding for delivering ads on desktop to achieve the expected rate of 4%.

## Question 4

Pull weekly trends for both desktop and mobile of gsearch nonbrand keywords to see the impact on volume due to the change of bid up the channel since 2012-05-19

_Received date: Jun 09, 2012

#### SQL query 
```
SELECT 
	MIN(DATE(created_at)) AS week_start_date, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'desktop' THEN website_session_id 			ELSE NULL END) AS desktop_sessions, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'mobile' THEN website_session_id ELSE 		NULL END) AS mobile_sessions 
FROM website_sessions 
WHERE 
	created_at < '2012-06-09' AND 
	created_at > '2012-04-15' AND 
	utm_source = 'gsearch' AND 
	utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' 
GROUP BY 
	YEARWEEK(created_at);
```
#### Command & Results
```
python3 connect.py --question 4 --db 'mavenfuzzyfactory user password' -task 'run'
```

It is easier to see the trend with a multiple-line graph.

#### Comment
The chart has shown a soar of desktop sessions as bidding up while the mobile sessions slightly decreased. 
(It could be bidding down for mobile devices, or there is an inverse relationship with desktop sessions).

## Question 5
For further investigation into the SEM channels, the company also wants to optimise the platforms.
Compare 2 SEM platforms Google & Bing, by conversion rate slicing by device type.

_Received date: Dec 01, 2012_

#### SQL query 
```
SELECT 
	ws.device_type,
	ws.utm_source,
	COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id)  AS sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) AS conv_rate
FROM website_sessions ws
LEFT JOIN orders o
	ON o.website_session_id = ws.website_session_id
WHERE 
	ws.created_at > '2012-08-22'
	AND ws.created_at < '2012_09_19'
	AND ws.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY 
	ws.device_type,
	ws.utm_source;
```
#### Command & Results
```
python3 connect.py --question 5 --db 'mavenfuzzyfactory user password' -task 'run'
```

#### Comments
Only gsearch-nonbrand-desktop campaign gains the expected CTR. Although the bsearch-nonbrand-desktop did not get a conversion rate of 4%, it has a significantly high conversion rate. 
As a feature of SEM, the inventory may not always be available. If the inventory in Google is enough, the team could bid down the bsearch campaign. Otherwise, the team could optimise ad content to improve the rate on bsearch-nonbrand-desktop.

Ads in Google search on both devices have higher CTR compared to Bing search.

## Question 6
Pull organic search, direct type-in, and paid brand search sessions by the month, and show those sessions a % of paid search nonbrand.

_Received date: Dec 23, 2012_

#### SQL query 
Using CASE WHEN to classify into different channels, then subquery to count sessions and group by time and channels.
```
SELECT 
	YEAR(created_at) AS year,
	MONTH(created_at) AS month,
	COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions,
	channel_group
FROM (	
	SELECT
		website_session_id,
		created_at,
		CASE
			WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IN ('https://www.bsearch.com','https://www.gsearch.com') THEN 'organic_search'
			WHEN utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN 'paid_nonbrand'
			WHEN utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN 'paid_brand'
			WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NULL THEN 'direct'
		END AS channel_group
	FROM website_sessions
	WHERE created_at < '2012-12-23') AS channel_group
WHERE channel_group IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1,2,4;
```
#### Command & Results
```
python3 connect.py --question 6 --db 'mavenfuzzyfactory user password' -task 'run'
```
