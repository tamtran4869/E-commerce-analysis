# Time series analysis
Looking at the performance of the business over time to determine the pattern. It could use for seasonal analysis and user online behaviour analysis. 

## Question 10

Take a look at 2012â€™s monthly and weekly volume patterns by session volume and order volume.

_Received date: Jan 02, 2013_

#### SQL query 
```sql
SELECT 
	MONTH(ws.created_at) AS month,
	COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) AS sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) AS conv_rate
FROM website_sessions ws
LEFT JOIN orders o
	ON ws.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE ws.created_at <'2013-01-01'
GROUP BY 1;

```

#### Comments
Overall, all metrics increased during the last three months, especially sessions in Nov. The reasons could be the rise of demands in the holiday season and effective optimisation in marketing and website.
Besides, the conversion chart showed a clear increasing trend. Although Dec was not the month with the highest sessions and orders,
it was the highest conversion rate. It proved the excellent work of the team in optimisation.

In my opinion, more data is needed for further conclusions about seasonality (e.g. month or week).

## Question 11

Analyse the average website session volume by hours of the day and by day of the week and avoid the 
holiday period and use a date range of Sep 15 - Nov 15, 2012.

A heatmap is a great choice to visualise this type of data.

#### Comments

Sessions focus on Monday to Friday during office time (8-17), especially Wednesday, with two peaks at 11 and 15. From this insight, the marketing team could set up time targeting reasonably, and the support team could plan staff schedule to deal with high volumes.

Interestingly, the heatmap looked like the behaviour of B2B. It could be the desktop-device targeting of marketing campaigns and massive demand from B2B clients. Following two hypotheses, the team could target mobile devices on weekends and off-hours; the company could investigate more the B2B sections.
